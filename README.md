## Script to run Tagasaurus on Linux, with remounting storage if it mounted without required permissions.

## From local folder on USB or other storage
```sh
# cd to folder where script placed, then run:
cp ./tagasaurus-run.sh /tmp && source /tmp/tagasaurus-run.sh $PWD

# download script to current folder:
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ww7/Tagasaurus-run-linux/main/tagasaurus-run.sh
```

Script looks Tagasaurus in the current and above directory. Will remount contaning storage with proper permissions for run if storage not allowed to `exec`.

Working with running by `source`, also if storage allowed to `exec` and doesn't require remounting - can be called with double-click or bash.

If script placed in parent directory - will search all Tagasaurus folders and runs the first valid.

Script can be run from any folder where path to Tagasaurus/USB drive/parent folder specified as argument to the script


## "HTTP" script version, that runs script directly from Github
```sh
# script downloading and running
source <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ww7/Tagasaurus-run-linux/main/tagasaurus-run-http.sh)
```

"HTTP" script version searching Tagasaurus over all USB drives mounted with FAT filesystem, then check if that USB drive doesn't allow program executing and remount with proper permissions for run.

Also, if found TagasaurusFiles data folder on USB drive and no Tagasaurus itself â€“ propose to download.

Script can be easily extended for Tagasaurus updating to the latest version and for downloading to specified path (as script argument) or to first corresponding USB drive found on system.

# Note
Remounting require a `sudo`. It will ask a user password.
